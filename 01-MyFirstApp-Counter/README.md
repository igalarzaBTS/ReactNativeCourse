# Flex App

Flex allows us to position the created components and relate them to each other to create the application interface. In this section, we will base on the three main flex blocks:

- Box Object Model
- Position
- Flex Layout

# Instructions

To view all the created screens, please comment on the screen you want to see in the "App.tsx" class

```
  App.tsx


  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#404985', }}>
    {/* <BoxObjectModelScreen /> */}
    {/* < DimensionsScreen /> */}
    {/* <RelativePositionScreen /> */}
    {/* <AbsolutePositionScreen /> */}
    {/* <FlexScreen /> */}
    <FlexHomework />
    </SafeAreaView>
  )
```
